Amazon Shopping provides a product-search feature that makes browsing products easier. Instead of showing exact matches only, it also displays transformable results for better browsing, A word a is said to be transformable to a word b if a is a subsequence of b. Given searchWord and resultWord, find the minimum number of characters that must be appended at the end of searchWord, such that resultWord is a subsequence of the modified searchWord.

Note: A subsequence of a string is a string that results from deleting 0 or more characters from the string without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, amazon is a subsequence of abcmmdaqzxopn while abc is not a subsequence of cdhbqaab.

Example :

Input :
searchWord="armaze"
resultWord = "amazon"
Output :
2
