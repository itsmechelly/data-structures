Amazon sellers sometimes provide a link to documentation about a product they are offering.
Documentation is usually large, so it is broken into an even number of volumes for download.

Each volume:
* is stored in a node instance as SinglyLinkedListNode
* has a page count stored in data
* has a pointer to the next volume stored in next

A customer will read the first and last volumes each day, removing the volumes from the list read on any day.

Given a reference to the head of a singly-linked list, calculate the maximum number of pages read on any day.

Note: Try to create a solution that has a space complexity of O(1).

Example:
The linked list is as follows:
1 > 4 > 3 > 2
On the first day, the customer reads the volumes with page counts 1 and 2, and removes them from the list. The number of pages read on the first day is 1 + 2 = 3.
The new list is:
4 > 3
On the second day, the customer reads the two remaining volumes with page counts 4 and 3.
The number of pages read on the second day is 4 + 3 = 7.
The list is now empty.

Since 7 > 3, the maximum number of page reads is 7.
