In order to ensure account security, the developers at Amazon have come up with a new algorithm to determine the strength of a password.

According to this algorithm, the strength of password consisting of lowercase English letters only, is calculated as the sum of the numbers of distinct characters present in all possicle substrings of that password.

Given a string password, find the strength of that password.

Note: A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string taken in the same order.

Example:
string "good"
should return 16
