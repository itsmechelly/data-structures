- Before I started, I was considered which approach is better: using HashSet vs Array.
- Eventually I decided to use the Array because using HashSet will lead my code to O(26*N^2) complexity.
- With the Array approach it seems to have complexity of O(n).

- The Array approach:
- I have a function that gets a String s as an input.
- I define an Array that with size of constant 26.
- The password can contain only lowercase letters, so I run on a loop to make sure only lowercase letters are acceptable, if not the function will return -1.
- In the second loop I convert all letters to ascii int values, then count each appearance combined with the other letters.

Time complexity O(n)
Space complexity O(1)
