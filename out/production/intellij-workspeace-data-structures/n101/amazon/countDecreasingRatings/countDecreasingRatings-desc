Amazon Shopping recently launched a new item whose daily customer ratings for n days are represented by the array ratings. They monitor these ratings to identify products that are not performing well. Find the number of groups that can be formed consisting of 1 or more consecutive days such that the ratings continuously decrease over the days.

The ratings are consecutively decreasing if it has the form: r,r-1,r-2.. and so on, where r is the rating on the first days of the group being considered. Two groups are considered different if they contain the ratings of different consecutive days.

Example
ratings = [4, 3, 5, 4, 3]

There are 9 periods in which the rating consecutively decreases.

5 one day periods: [4], [3], [5], [4], [3]
3 two day periods: [4, 3], [5, 4], [4, 3]
1 three day period: [5, 4, 3]
Return 9
