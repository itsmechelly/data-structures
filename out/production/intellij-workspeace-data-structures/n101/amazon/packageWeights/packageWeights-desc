To increase efficiency, the Amazon shipping team will group packages being shipped according to weight. They will merge a lighter package with a heavier package, which eliminates the need for separate shipments.
More formally, consider n packages, where packageWeightsffi represents the weight of the nth package. You can combine the ith and (1,11th package if packageWeights[i] a packageWeights[i+1], then discard the th package. After this operation, the number of packages is reduced by 1 and the weight of the i+1 package increases by packageWeights[i]. You can merge the packages any number of times.
Find the maximum possible weight of a package that can be achieved after any sequence of merge-operations.
Example For example, packages are described as package weights = 12, 9, 10, 3, n

The optimal order of operations is, using 1-based indexing:
• Combine the packages at index 2 and index 3, the new array of package weights becomes [2, 19, 3, 7]. • Combine the packages at index 1 and Index 2, the new array of package weights becomes [21, 3, 7]. • Combine the packages at index 2 and Index 3, the new array of package weights becomes [21, 10].
We can not combine the packages anymore.
